# Chelsea-FC-Insights

In this project, I aimed to examine how Chelsea has evolved under the BlueCo takeover led by Todd Boehly.
I examined their on-field success and performance, and also analysed their transfer strategy by collating transfer data from 2019/20 to 2024/25.
With this data, I looked at how Chelsea buys players for low fees, sells for profit, but also looked at their extortionate spending.
